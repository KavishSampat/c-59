  <p id="wif"> What is Football? </p> 
  <br>
  <p id="wif"> Football, also called association football or soccer, is a game involving two teams of 11 players who try to maneuver the ball into the other team's goal without using their hands or arms. The team that scores more goals wins. Football is the world's most popular ball game in numbers of participants and spectators.</p> 
  <br>
  <p id="wif"> I like football so much as it is good for fitness and is a team game. It helps build, strength, stamina and speed. It trains your brain, improves your concentration and coordination. Promotes teamwork, being social and boosting your confidence. Improves your teamwork with others. My favourite football player is Lionel Messi.
